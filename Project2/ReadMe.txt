This project is based on C++. But I've tried coding just like in C except a new data struct vector. It's not supposed to stop you from reading source code due to unfamiliar grammar.

To be brief, the purpose and expected output of each test case are written in Chap.3 in my report. There's only figures in TestCase.txt.

If you want to write test case on your own, please format your input like this:
    First line: 	Number of nodes in your tree.
    Second line: Traversal sequence of in-order.
    Third line: 	Traversal sequence of pre-order.
    Fourth line: Traversal sequence of post-order.
For example:
    9                   //number of nodes
    3 - 2 1 7 9 - 4 6   //in-order traversal
    9 - 5 3 2 1 - 6 4   //pre-order traversal
    3 1 - - 7 - 6 8 -   //post-order traversal
Tree nodes are numbered from 1 to N , no repetition and no number is given out of the range.
